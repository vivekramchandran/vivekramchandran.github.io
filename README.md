THIS PROJECT USED HTML AND CSS IN ORDER TO MAKE A GITHUB USER WEBSITE.  IT (HOPEFULLY) CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTS A MAIN PAGE, WITH TWO LINKS TO BOTH A BIOGRAPHY AND A RESUME.  IT HAS A PHOTO THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE FRONT PAGE.  THE HTML CODE MAINLY USES UNORDERED LISTS AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT HEADINGS FOR THE WRITING.  IT TOOK ME ROUGHLY 8 HOURS TO FINISH THIS PROJECT, AS I HAD A CONSIDERABLE LEARNING CURVE AND INCORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED EVERYTHING THE FIRST TIME.  I DID THIS ASSIGNMENT BY MYSELF.
