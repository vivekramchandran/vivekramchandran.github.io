This project used HTML and CSS in order to make a Github user website.  It (hopefully) correctly implements a main page,
with two links to both a biography and a resume.  It has a photo that is attached to the front page.  The HTML code mainly
uses unordered lists and a variety of different headings for the writing.  It took me roughly 8 hours to finish this project,
as I had a considerable learning curve and incorrectly implemented everything the first time.  I did this assignment by myself.
